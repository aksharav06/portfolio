Hi! My name is Akshara Vaghela, I'm a grade 10 student studying in Turner Fenton Secondary School
in the IB program. A little facts about me are that I'm a programmer born and brought up in Canada.
Other then programming, my hobbies are listening to music as I find it therapeutic, watching tv shows 
especially kdramas, hanging out with people as I'm an extrovert, and I absolutely adore eating. If the 
food is edible and vegetarian, I would eat it. My programming goal is to become a more efficient programmer and 
gain more experiences with programming by continuing to create more projects in the future and broaden the amount 
of programming languages I know.
